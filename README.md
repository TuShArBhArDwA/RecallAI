## Overview

RecallAI combines modern backend architecture with advanced orchestration and memory features to deliver an intelligent chatbot system. It supports both text and voice interactions, enabling enterprises and developers to build AI assistants that remember past conversations, coordinate across multiple agents, and scale securely for multi-tenant environments.

---

## Core Highlights

### Authentication & Multi-Tenancy
- OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens
- User registration and tenant isolation for secure data handling
- Role-based permissions for fine-grained access control

### Multi-Agent Orchestration (LangGraph)
- Supervisor agent for workflow coordination
- Research agent for knowledge retrieval
- Scraper agent for summarizing web content
- Handles multi-step workflows with persistent context

### Vector Search with Qdrant
- Tenant-specific vector storage for embeddings
- Semantic search across conversation history
- Metadata and payload filtering for efficient lookups

### Persistent Memory (Mem0)
- Cross-session and cross-chat memory
- Selective long-term storage of key facts
- Context-aware retrieval of relevant memory

### MCP Tool Integration
- Firecrawl for structured web scraping and summarization
- Tavily for semantic, real-time web search

### Voice Mode (LiveKit)
- Voice conversations powered by WebRTC
- Deepgram STT and Cartesia TTS for natural speech
- Voice activity detection for smooth interaction
- Multilingual support

### Observability with LangSmith
- Execution tracing and debugging
- Token usage and latency monitoring
- Feedback collection and experiment tracking

### Web UI
- React frontend with Material UI
- Responsive design with chat bubbles and avatars
- Markdown rendering for rich responses
- Switch between text and voice modes seamlessly

---

## Backend Architecture

- FastAPI backend with async APIs
- SQLAlchemy + SQLite/Postgres for persistence
- Qdrant for vector storage
- Pydantic models for validation
- JWT/OAuth2 for authentication
- React frontend with real-time chat

---
## Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Sign Up**  
   - Visit `/register` to create your account  
   - Provide a username, password, and tenant_id  
   - Each tenant_id ensures that your data remains isolated and private  

2. **Log In**  
   - Log in from the main page using your credentials  
   - A JWT token is generated and stored securely for your API requests  

---

### Chat Interface

1. **Start a New Conversation**  
   - Use the "+" button in the sidebar to create a conversation  
   - Assign a meaningful title for quick reference later  
   - Conversations are saved under your tenant_id  

2. **Chatting with the Assistant**  
   - Enter a message in the text box and press Enter or click Send  
   - Responses stream back in real-time, token by token  
   - Messages include user/assistant avatars for clarity  
   - Markdown is supported for formatting responses  

3. **Manage Conversations**  
   - Access older chats directly from the sidebar  
   - Search through past sessions easily  

---

### Voice Assistant

1. **Enable Voice Mode**  
   - Click the microphone button in the chat window  
   - Allow microphone access when prompted  
   - Wait for the "Ready" indicator before speaking  

2. **Voice Conversations**  
   - Speak naturally when the "Listening..." message appears  
   - The assistant transcribes and replies with speech  
   - Both your speech and the AIâ€™s response appear on screen  

3. **Extra Voice Features**  
   - Automatic detection when you stop speaking  
   - Noise filtering with voice activity detection (VAD)  
   - Multilingual conversation support  
   - Adjustable settings for voice quality  

4. **Close Voice Session**  
   - Click the disconnect button to end the session  
   - All history remains saved with your account  

---

### External Tools

The assistant can extend its capabilities through integrated tools:

- **Web Search** â€“ Retrieve fresh, up-to-date information  
- **Web Scraping** â€“ Summarize or extract details from specific pages
